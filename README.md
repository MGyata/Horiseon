# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

Challenge 1 refactoring code to help develop working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Github
I was tasked with organizing symantic HTML and condesing CSS to make for a more concise coding experience for future teams working on the Horiseon website.

Accessibility attributes were added to enhance the SEA and ensure the accessibility standards are met.

I applied everything I learned on clean code and was able to make the code less redundent by applying proper ID and Class elements to HTML and linking directly through CSS.

Refactoring details

-When source code is viewed you will now find logical symantic HTML structure
-When image elements are viewed accessible alt attributes are now found for all image elements
-added concise title 
-when heading elements are viewed all are in sequential order
